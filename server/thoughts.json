So, when I wanted to rebuild my personal website, I knew I wanted a tab where I could easily post my thoughts and have it all in one place to come back to. I feel I'll be journaling a lot more as I move to SF after graduating and I'll have a lot to reflect on so hopefully this page will get pretty big so one day I can look back on  these thoughts I had back in my 20s!\n\nNote to self: Add an edit page for thought page/admin profile maybe if I end up using this a lot.",
